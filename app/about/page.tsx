        I had the opportunity to participate in Sofascore Frontend Academy where
        I expanded my knowledge about React.js and Next.js. 🎓 Worked
        independently on three websites and one app during internship. Currently
        working on two apps in React Native. As I continue my education, I&#39;m
        seeking a student internship or part-time role to further enhance my
        skills and contribute to exciting projects. 📚👩‍💻
